## Project Overview

Pagbutlak Website is a news publishing platform for UPV Pagbutlak, the official student and community publication of the University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV) - College of Arts and Sciences (CAS).

Content sections: News, Features, Opinion, Kultura. There's also a Multimedia section for video content (YouTube, Facebook, TikTok).

The CMS has custom RBAC with three roles (`admin`/`editor`/`writer` on `Users.role`) enforcing a draft -> review -> publish workflow; see [Access Control (RBAC)](#access-control-rbac).

| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| CMS             | Payload CMS (headless)                   |
| Framework       | Next.js (App Router)                     |
| Database        | PostgreSQL via `@payloadcms/db-postgres` |
| Language        | TypeScript (strict mode)                 |
| Styling         | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui                 |
| Rich Text       | Lexical (`@payloadcms/richtext-lexical`) |
| Package Manager | pnpm (DO NOT use npm or yarn)            |
| Testing         | Vitest (integration), Playwright (E2E)   |
| Deployment      | Vercel / Docker (standalone output)      |

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up
```

This starts two containers: `payload` (Node.js 22 Alpine) and `postgres` (PostgreSQL 16 Alpine). The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

For non-Docker setup, ensure `DATABASE_URI` points to a local Postgres instance (e.g., `localhost:5432`).

## Commands

| `CRON_SECRET`            | Cron job authentication        |
| `PREVIEW_SECRET`         | Preview request validation     |

## Coding Patterns

### Migrations - Never Manually Create Files

Always use the Payload CLI to create migrations:

```bash
pnpm payload migrate:create add_section_field
```

This generates `.ts` and `.json` files with timestamps and SQL scaffolding. The migration name should be a descriptive snake_case string (e.g., `add_section_field`, `rename_posts_to_articles`).

After creating a migration:

1. Edit the generated `up()` and `down()` functions with your SQL.
2. Register the new migration in `src/migrations/index.ts` - import it and append an entry to the `migrations` array.
3. Run `pnpm payload migrate` to apply.

**Never** edit a migration file that has already been applied to a deployed environment. Create a new migration instead.

### Types - Regenerate After Schema Changes

After modifying any Payload collection or global config, run:

```bash
pnpm generate:types
```

This regenerates `src/payload-types.ts`. Never hand-edit this file. Import types from `@/payload-types` in components and hooks.

### Import Map - Regenerate After Adding Admin Components

After adding new components used in the Payload admin panel (custom fields, custom components), run:

```bash
pnpm generate:importmap
```

### Seeding

- `seed()` in `src/endpoints/seed/index.ts` is the single source of truth for seed data. Both the Admin UI and `pnpm seed` use it.
- Seeding is destructive: it clears seeded collections before repopulating them. Never run it against a database containing content that must be preserved.
- The CLI (`pnpm seed`) uses the Local API directly and requires an existing user in the `users` collection.
- Any `payload.create`, `update`, or `updateGlobal` call added to `seed()` must pass `context: { disableRevalidate: true }` to prevent Next.js revalidation hooks from running outside a request context.
- When seeding an S3-backed database, ensure the `S3_*` environment variables are available to the environment running the seed command; otherwise media files may be written to local disk instead of S3.

### Access Control (RBAC)

- Three roles on `Users.role` (`admin`/`editor`/`writer`, `saveToJWT: true`). Writers can create/edit their own drafts but cannot publish, unpublish, or schedule-publish - editors/admins can. Ownership is tracked via a `createdBy` field (set by `setCreatedBy` hook) on Articles/Issues/Multimedia/Pages.
- Since `_status` is an implicit field (from `versions.drafts`), publish/unpublish gating is enforced via `beforeChange` hooks (`preventUnauthorizedPublish`, `preventUnauthorizedSchedulePublish`), not field-level access.
- `jobs.runHooks: true` in `payload.config.ts` is required for `preventUnauthorizedSchedulePublish` to run - Payload's job queue skips collection hooks by default.
- When adding new roles/permissions or new collections that need ownership scoping, follow the existing pattern in `src/access/` and `src/hooks/` rather than introducing a new mechanism.

## Code Conventions

### Style

- **Prettier**: single quotes, no semicolons, trailing commas, 100 char print width
- **ESLint**: `next/core-web-vitals` + `next/typescript` with custom rules

### Git

- Use Conventional Commits (enforced by commitlint): `type(scope): concise description`.
- Keep commits atomic: each commit should represent one logical, self-contained change.
- Keep commit messages concise. Add a description only when necessary.
- Do not co-author commits or include yourself in commit messages.
- Do not use `--no-verify` or otherwise bypass Git hooks.
- Do not bypass GPG signing. If a commit cannot be signed because GPG is locked or requires user interaction, stop and ask the user to unlock GPG before continuing.
- Do not amend, rebase, reset, or otherwise rewrite existing commits unless explicitly requested.
- Before committing, inspect the diff and ensure it contains only intended changes.
- When updating a branch with changes from its base branch, prefer rebasing over merging.

#### Branches

- Use descriptive branch names with the format `type/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/add-search`, `fix/article-slug`); prefer `feat/` over `feature/`.
- Do not include issue number in branch names.
- Keep branches focused on a single issue or logical change.
- Create a dedicated branch for each change. Do not make changes directly on the default branch.

#### Issues

- Follow the GitHub issue template.
- Add relevant GitHub labels; do not add labels speculatively.
- Add relevant issue type.
- Assign the issue to the current user.
- Link issue to GitHub project "pagbutlak website".
- Create an issue before opening a PR when the change is substantial enough to warrant dedicated tracking. For one-off changes, quick fixes, or simple patches that do not benefit from a dedicated issue, a PR may be created directly unless the user explicitly requests an issue.

#### Pull Requests

- Follow the GitHub PR template.
- Add relevant GitHub labels; do not add labels speculatively.
- Assign the PR to the current user.
- Link the PR to its corresponding issue using `Closes #<issue-number>` when the PR fully resolves the issue.
- If a corresponding issue exists but the PR does not fully resolve it, link the issue without using a closing keyword.
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized.
- Do not mark a PR ready for review while required checks are failing or known issues remain.

### File Organization

- Each collection/global is a folder or file in `src/collections/` or `src/globals/` exporting a config
- CMS blocks go in `src/blocks/` - each block is a folder with a component and config
- Reusable access control functions go in `src/access/`
- Shared Payload field definitions go in `src/fields/`
- Frontend pages follow Next.js App Router conventions in `src/app/(frontend)/`
- Payload admin and API routes are in `src/app/(payload)/`

### React Component File Structure

Each component should have its own named folder:

```
ComponentName/
├── index.tsx   # Component implementation
└── index.scss  # Styles (if applicable)
```

- **Do:** Create a folder per component with `index.tsx` and optional `index.scss`
- **Don't:** Place multiple `ComponentName.tsx` files in a single folder with one shared `.scss` file
- Re-export from barrel files (`index.ts`) when grouping related components in a parent directory

## Best Practices

- **Object parameters for function arguments**
- **Prefer types over interfaces** (except when extending external types)
- **Prefer functions over classes** (classes only for errors/adapters)
- **Prefer pure functions** - when mutation is unavoidable, return the mutated object instead of void
- **Organize functions top-down** - exports before helpers
- **Use `import type` for types**, regular `import` for values, separate statements even from the same module
- **Prefix booleans** with `is`/`has`/`can`/`should` (e.g. `isValid`, `hasData`, `canEdit`) for clarity
- **Prefer self-describing names** over generic names with comments to explain their purpose

## Verification

- Verify every code change before considering the task complete.
- Run the checks relevant to the files and behavior changed.
- At minimum, run `pnpm lint` for code changes.
- Run `pnpm test:int` when changing backend, Payload, database, access control, hooks, or other integration behavior.
- Run `pnpm test:e2e` when changing frontend behavior, routes, navigation, forms, or other end-to-end flows.
- Run `pnpm build` only for changes that may affect the production build, configuration, dependencies, or deployment.
- Never run `pnpm build` against a directory/container where `pnpm dev` is already running. Both write to the same `.next` output directory by default; a concurrent build corrupts the dev server's webpack cache and manifests. Instead, isolate the verification build with `BUILD_DIR`:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec -e BUILD_DIR=.next-verify payload pnpm build
  docker compose exec payload rm -rf .next-verify
  ```
  Note: Next's dev-typegen may rewrite the shared `tsconfig.json` to reference `<BUILD_DIR>/types/**/*.ts` as a side effect. Discard that change rather than committing it.
- Use Playwright/browser automation ONLY WHEN NEEDED for browser behavior, end-to-end verification, or visual inspection of UI changes. Prefer static inspection and existing tests when sufficient; avoid unnecessary browser interactions and screenshots.
